# Therapist Copilot ðŸ§ 

AI-assisted emotional pattern insight from patient journaling.

## Overview

Patients often write their most honest emotional reflections **outside** of therapy â€” in journals, notes, and late-night thoughts.
This system takes a week's worth of journal entries and helps therapists understand:

- **Recurring emotional patterns** â€” Identifying themes that appear across multiple entries
- **Trigger â†’ Response â†’ Coping cycles** â€” Understanding emotional cause-and-effect chains
- **Mood / language shifts** â€” Detecting changes in emotional tone and expression
- **Possible areas to explore in session** â€” Surfacing topics worth deeper therapeutic exploration

### Important Note

**We are not replacing therapy.**
We are giving therapists **clarity**, not advice. This tool is designed to augment the therapeutic relationship by providing data-driven insights that inform â€” not replace â€” clinical judgment.

## Architecture (Simple MVP)

```
data/journals.json â†’ backend GPT Pattern Analyzer â†’ data/summary.json â†’ frontend dashboard UI
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- No live SMS input needed for MVP
- Using example journal entries to simulate a week's emotional data
- Focus on pattern recognition and clear visualization
- Privacy-first approach (all data stays local during development)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Backend:**
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

**Frontend:**
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- Modern web browser

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd therapist-copilot
```

#### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

#### 4. Add Sample Data

Create `data/journals.json` with sample entries (see format below).

---

## Usage

### Running the Backend

```bash
cd backend
python analyzer.py
```

This will:
1. Read entries from `data/journals.json`
2. Analyze patterns using GPT
3. Generate `data/summary.json`

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard.

## Data Formats

### Input: `data/journals.json`

```json
{
  "patient_id": "anonymous_001",
  "week_start": "2025-01-12",
  "week_end": "2025-01-18",
  "entries": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-12",
      "time": "22:30",
      "text": "I felt really overwhelmed today at work. Everyone needed something from me and I couldn't say no. By the time I got home, I just wanted to disappear."
    },
    {
      "date": "2025-01-13",
      "time": "14:15",
      "text": "I wanted to reach out to Sarah but didn't. I convinced myself she's probably busy and doesn't want to hear from me anyway. Why do I always do this?"
    },
    {
      "date": "2025-01-14",
      "time": "09:00",
      "text": "Woke up feeling heavy again. This is the third day in a row. I used to love mornings."
    }
