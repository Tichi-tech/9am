# Therapist Copilot ðŸ§ 
AI-assisted emotional pattern insight from patient journaling.

## Overview
Patients often write their most honest emotional reflections **outside** of therapy â€” in journals, notes, and late-night thoughts.  
This system takes a week's worth of journal entries and helps therapists understand:

- Recurring emotional patterns  
- Trigger â†’ Response â†’ Coping cycles  
- Mood / language shifts  
- Possible areas to explore in session  

**We are not replacing therapy.**  
We are giving therapists **clarity**, not advice.
