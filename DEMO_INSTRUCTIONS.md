## Demo Script for Different Audiences

### For Therapists (Clinical Focus)

**Opening:**
"This is Sarah, week 1 of therapy. She's experiencing severe social anxiety and daily panic attacks."

[Show Week 1 analysis]

"The AI identifies 3 high-severity patterns and provides 5 specific clinical prompts for your next session. This took 5 seconds."

"Now look at week 4..."

[Show Week 4 analysis + dashboard]

"Same patient, 4 weeks later. The AI tracks her progress objectively: sentiment up 60 points, panic attacks from daily to occasional. You can show her this chart as proof that therapy is working."

**Close:**
"This doesn't replace your clinical judgment. It augments it with data you don't have time to track manually."

### For Investors (Business Focus)

**Opening:**
"Mental health crisis: 1 in 5 adults, but only 1 therapist per 1,000 patients. Therapists are overwhelmed."

**Problem:**
"Therapists spend 30-45 minutes per patient reviewing journals before sessions. For 20 patients, that's 40-60 hours monthly of manual work."

**Solution:**
"Therapist Copilot automates journal analysis using GPT-4, reducing prep time by 95%."

[Show dashboard]

**Market:**
- 500,000 therapists in US alone
- $10-20/month SaaS model
- $60-120M addressable market
- Low CAC (direct to therapist)

**Traction:**
[Show demo results]
"Here's a 4-week case showing measurable improvement. This is the data therapists need but don't have time to collect."

### For Hackathon Judges (Technical + Impact)

**Technical:**
- Flask backend with OpenAI GPT-4o API
- Two-tier analysis: Weekly ‚Üí Long-term (efficient)
- JSON-structured outputs
- Cost: ~$0.01 per weekly analysis

**Innovation:**
"Most mental health AI focuses on chatbots. We focus on therapist productivity. Our long-term trend analysis is unique - it analyzes weekly summaries, not raw entries, making month/year analysis possible."

**Impact:**
- Saves 40-60 hours/month per therapist
- Earlier detection of concerning patterns
- Quantifiable patient progress
- Reduced therapist burnout

**Scalability:**
"Currently handles 1 patient. Architecture supports multi-patient with minor changes. Can scale to thousands of therapists with same backend."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Does this replace therapists?**
A: No. It's a tool to save time on administrative work, like spell-check for writing. The therapist still does therapy.

**Q: What about privacy/HIPAA?**
A: For MVP, data stays local. Production version will use encrypted storage and HIPAA-compliant infrastructure.

**Q: How accurate is the AI?**
A: It identifies patterns therapists would find manually, just faster. Clinical judgment is still required. Think of it as a research assistant.

**Q: What if the AI is wrong?**
A: Therapists review all insights before using them. It's decision support, not decision making.

**Q: Can it handle months/years of data?**
A: Yes! That's our unique feature. Long-term trend analysis looks at weekly summaries, making it efficient even for years of data.

**Q: Cost?**
A: ~$0.01-0.03 per week of analysis. For monthly analysis: ~$0.04-0.12/patient/month.

## Tips for a Great Demo

### Do:
‚úÖ Let the data speak - show the progression visually
‚úÖ Use the timeline and chart to show improvement
‚úÖ Emphasize time savings (30-45 min ‚Üí 5 sec)
‚úÖ Show both weekly AND long-term analysis
‚úÖ Mention the cost ($0.01 per analysis)

### Don't:
‚ùå Get too technical about GPT-4 unless asked
‚ùå Claim it replaces therapists
‚ùå Skip the long-term analysis (that's your differentiator!)
‚ùå Forget to mention HIPAA compliance is planned

### Pause Points:
1. After Week 1 - Ask: "How long would this take manually?"
2. After dashboard - Ask: "Have you ever seen this kind of longitudinal data?"
3. After value prop - Ask: "What would you use this for first?"
