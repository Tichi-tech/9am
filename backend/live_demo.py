Perfect for showing stakeholders how the system works!
This script:
1. Shows you a raw journal entry
2. Processes it through the pipeline in real-time
3. Displays the AI-generated insights

Today was rough. Had a panic attack during the team meeting. My heart was racing
and I felt like everyone was staring at me. I had to step out. Again.

I'm so tired of feeling like this. My therapist says I'm making progress but I
don't see it. Keep canceling plans with friends because I'm too anxious to leave
the house. Mom called and I didn't pick up. What would I even say?

Tried that breathing exercise tonight. It helped a little, I guess. But I still
feel like I'm drowning most of the time.
""",

    "depression": """
Woke up at 2pm. Couldn't find a reason to get out of bed earlier. Everything
feels heavy and pointless. Scrolled on my phone for hours but nothing made me
feel anything.

Jake texted asking if I wanted to grab coffee. Said I was busy. I wasn't. I just
can't fake being okay right now. He probably thinks I hate him. I don't. I hate me.

Therapist tomorrow. Part of me wants to cancel. What's the point of talking about
the same things over and over? But I promised myself I'd try. One day at a time,
or whatever they say.
""",

    "improvement": """
Actually had a good day today. Is that allowed? Went for a walk this morning and
the sun felt nice. Weird how I'm almost suspicious of feeling okay.

Made it through the work presentation without panicking. Used those breathing
techniques my therapist taught me. They actually worked! People even said I did
well. Old me wouldn't believe this is possible.

Called Mom back. We talked for 20 minutes and it was nice. I told her about therapy
and she was supportive. Why did I think she wouldn't understand?

Still anxious but it doesn't control me like it used to. Progress is real.
